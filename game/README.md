Fun and interactive game which allows students to control the sprite on the computer screen using an EV3 controller. The main goal of this game is to capture as many tiles as the players can and help their team win. To capture the tiles, players need to move their sprites over the tiles, however it can be re-captured by the opponent team before the timer runs out.
